# Redirect to Heroku
This is a simple website to get the heroku deploy link from a github repository.

## Usage

- Open the [Redirect to Heroku Website](https://RakeshYt1.github.io/HerokuFuck)
    - You can pass `src` parameter to add fork button on the page. Once you passed it you can't get the deploy link for the same github repo

That's it!
